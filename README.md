# parser

This project is a parser developed in Racket, utilizing the Megaparsack library. It's designed to parse a custom language from text files, converting file contents into a single string and processing this string to match various syntactic productions. The parser handles different types of statements, expressions, identifiers, and numbers, incorporating both syntax and semantics of a custom-designed language. The primary goal is to demonstrate how to build a complex parser using functional programming paradigms and parser combinators provided by Megaparsack.

Dependencies
Racket
Megaparsack Library
parser-tools/lex (for lexer functionality, not explicitly shown in the provided code but necessary for a complete parsing solution)

Handling Whitespace
The provided parser template does not explicitly handle whitespace, which is crucial for correctly interpreting many languages. You may need to integrate whitespace handling into your grammar definitions to ignore or consume whitespace appropriately.

Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling is recommended to enhance the parser's usability, providing clear feedback on syntax errors or unrecognized tokens.

Extending the Parser
Custom Language Features: Extend the parser by defining additional parsers for new language constructs as required by your grammar.
Whitespace and Comments: Incorporate parsers for handling whitespace and comments according to the needs of your language.
Error Reporting: Improve error reporting by capturing line and column information, and providing meaningful error messages to the user.
